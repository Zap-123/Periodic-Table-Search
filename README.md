# Periodic-Table-Search
Struggling to find a specific element on the periodic table out of the 118? No problem!
Given a search query, this program in the terminal will find the element that corresponds to your query.

## Installation

All you will need is a Python IDE to run, view, and interact within the terminal.
This program does not require any installation -  it is simply run in a Python terminal
Packages used in the program:

* **time**
* **math**

These should be automatically downloaded and there should be no need for other installations.

If any issues occur, please make sure:

* You have installed Python correctly
* You have the latest version of Python
* You are using a reliable IDE (VSCode or PyCharm work phenomenally)

## Tutorial

Simply run the program in an IDE and the terminal will open.

You will then be prompted to insert a query, where you can search an element by atomic number, mass, symbol, or name!

A search will then run and if an element has been found, it will be returned to you.

That's all!

## Have Fun! ##
**Note:** The atomic masses listed in the data set are rounded to two decimal points. You may find a copy of the periodic table used in the program files.
